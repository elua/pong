pong.lua 
  Lua source file of an implementation of the classical Pong game, to run on
Luminary Micro's LM3S kits that have a RIT OLED display.

LM3S.lua
  Platform specific buttons and functions definitions.
  This module is require()d by Pong and included on the autorun version too.
  It's main goal is to simplify the use of some specific platform resources.

pong-autorun.bin
  Binary image, ready to be flashed to a proper LM3S kit, with the pong.lua
program built as an autorun.lua. This will make the program starts directly
after a reset.
